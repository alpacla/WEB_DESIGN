                Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist,
                 and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th 
                 century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] 
                 the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. 
                 Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting
                  Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during
                   the Spanish Civil War.

                Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood 
                and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, 
                techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical
                 styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of 
                modern art.[10][11][12][13]

                Picasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated,
                the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced 
                Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of 
                Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics
                of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.

                Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune 
                for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.
